ReadMe audio_mngr

This Tool is more to be a proof of conecpt, it's not well written, do not listen to code guidelines etc.
I used it just for me and my problems with pulse...

The writing and code style is lazy and probably buggy, please do not take this codestyle as an inspiration.

Basic Usage [Screenshoot]:
![Alt text](Screenshoot.png?raw=true "Screenshoot")

Dark Mode [Screenshoot]:
![Alt text](Screenshoot_DarkMode.png?raw=true "Screenshoot")

Features:
- Use cables to connect players, speakers, microphones, loops and monitors.
- Add and manage loops and virtual sinks
- Save and load configs
- Change the default speaker and mic via right click

Settings (via "File" --> "Options"):
- Dark Mode (more eye-friendly)
- Automatic reload of devices / programs if a change happends (seems to be stable so far)
- Option for always stay on top above all other programs
- Option to disable / enable the usage of pipewire
- Option to change the latency of loops (0..65536) in milliseconds (only works before the are created)

Installation:
- Download the i386 or x64 version of this tool from the /bin subdirectory for your PC
- Make sure pulse or pipewire is installed on your PC
- Mark the the binary as executeable

Basic usage:
- Start the program, you should see your audio devices as elements on the field
- Every interaction with the program is with the mouse only:
- Left mouseklick:
    - Connect a device with another one, incompatible devices will be marked in red
    - The connection is made via "Drag'n'Drop"
- Middle mousclick:
    - Mutes / Unmutes a device (is shown in gray)
 - Middle mouse-wheel:
 	- Changes the volume of a device
- Right mouseclick:
    - √çf the device is virtual (loop or virtual sink) a popup menu will show up, so that you can delete the device.
    - If a device isn't default you can set it as default
- Other options (Save... / Load... / Default (Speaker / Mic) are in the menu at the top of the program)

How to compile:
- Download and install CodeTyphon from https://www.pilotlogic.com/sitejoom/
- Clone the git to your PC
- Open the project-file with Typhon IDE
- Compile it...

Known problems:
- If a Program / Name is used mutible times the program can't tell the difference when loading from config
- The program was written with the german (UTF8) charset in mind and isn't in any way directly connected to pulse
  all actions / readings from pulse are executed via (bash) commands in the background it may be possible that it's not 
  working very well with other charsets (this should be fixed since V0.5)

Requirements:
- Installed Pulse Audio server and at most the command pactl, test with "pactl -h"
- The excuteables are build with gtk2 probably some libs are needed if you dont have gtk2 installed.
  If the program is not starting try running it via terminal it should show the missing librarys.


If someone want to rewrite the program in a more prefessional manner please do so.
For me it's working this way... As said it's more like a proof of concept for what pulse can actually do. 

Note: I can't speak english very well, sorry, I just wanted to solve my problem...

Best greetings
