This Tool is more to be a proof of conecpt, it's not well written, do not listen to code guidelines etc.
I used it just for me and my problems with pulse...

The writing and code style is lazy and probably buggy, please do not take this codestyle as an inspiration.

Installation:
- Download the i386 or x64 version of this tool for your PC
- Make sure pulse is installed on your PC
- Mark the the binary as executeable

How to compile:
- Download and install CodeTyphon from https://www.pilotlogic.com/sitejoom/
- Open the project eith the Typhon IDE

Known problems:
- If a Program / Name is used mutible times the program can't tell the difference when loading from config
- The program was written with the DE-DE-UTF8 charset in mind and isn't in any way directly connected to pulse
  all actions / readings from pulse are executed via (bash) commands in the background

If someone want to rewrite the program in a more prefessional manner please do so.
For me it's working this way... As said it's more like a proof of concept for what pulse can actually do. 

Note: I can't speak english very well, sorry, I just wanted to solve my problem...

Best greetings
